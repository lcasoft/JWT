The supported JWT signing algorithms are: HMAC-SHA (HS256, HS384, HS512), RSASSA-PKCS (RS256, RS384, RS512), ECDSA (Elliptic Curve - ES256, ES384, ES512), and RSASSA-PSS (PS256, PS384, PS512).

Ekko Proxy includes tools to encode/decode, format, match, and hash data, validate / encode JWT tokens - all safely from your local machine or server without the inherent dangers of using similar online tools.
